Preconditions

User account exists and is authenticated

Database is reachable

Test Data

Project name: GTMGraph QA Project

Idea name: PulsePilot

One-liner: AI assistant that turns customer calls into actionable follow-ups

Problem: Teams forget follow-ups and lose deals

Region: UK

Category: b2b_saas

Team size: 2

Timeline weeks: 8

Budget monthly: 500

Steps

Go to New Project

Fill required fields and click Create

Open the newly created project workspace

Fetch canonical state via backend (or inspect stored snapshot if you have tooling)

Expected Results

UI shows project created and a default Scenario A exists

Canonical state exists and contains required top-level keys:

meta, idea, constraints, inputs, evidence, decisions, pillars, graph, risks, execution, telemetry

meta.schema_version exists and is non-empty

execution.chosen_track equals unset

decisions.icp.selected_option_id is either empty or a placeholder that indicates not selected

graph.nodes, graph.edges, graph.groups exist as arrays (may be empty)

Data Integrity Checks

meta.project_id, meta.scenario_id, meta.run_id are valid IDs

meta.created_at and meta.updated_at are valid ISO date-times

No extra unknown keys exist at the root (schema enforcement)
