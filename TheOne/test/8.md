TC-008: Conflicting Evidence Updates Create Candidates and Validator Item
Purpose

If two evidence-based agents write different values to same field, system keeps alternatives and triggers validator.

Preconditions

Two agents produce evidence-based patches for same path

Steps

Agent A writes replace /pillars/market_to_money/summary with evidence

Agent B writes different summary also with evidence

Merge both

Expected Results

Canonical state does not silently overwrite

State contains: top value chosen OR a candidates structure (implementation choice)

Validator adds contradiction with severity at least medium or high

UI shows conflict needing user decision or acceptance
