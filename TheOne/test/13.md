TC-013: Partial Rerun Only Recomputes Dependent Nodes After ICP Change
Purpose

Ensure partial rerun logic works and does not rerun entire system.

Preconditions

Scenario has completed run with graph nodes generated

Steps

Change ICP decision

Trigger rerun subtree

Observe agent timings and updated nodes

Expected Results

Only dependent agents run: pricing, channels, sales motion, positioning optionally

Product and execution nodes remain unchanged unless dependent

Graph node updates limited to affected pillar groups

Time to update is significantly faster than full rerun

Data Integrity Checks

telemetry.agent_timings shows skipped agents

Nodes not dependent retain same updated_at timestamps
