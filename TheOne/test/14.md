TC-014: Node ID Stability Prevents Duplicate Nodes
Purpose

Ensure node updates are idempotent and stable IDs prevent duplication.

Preconditions

A run has already created nodes

Steps

Trigger same run again with no changes

Inspect graph.nodes

Expected Results

Node count remains the same

Each node ID appears once

Node updates are update, not create

No duplicate purpose nodes appear (e.g. two pricing metric nodes)
