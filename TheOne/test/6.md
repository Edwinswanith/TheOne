TC-006: Apply Patch Ordering Preserves Dependencies
Purpose

Ensure orchestrator applies patches in required order so decisions do not precede evidence.

Preconditions

A run is started with evidence collection and decision proposals

Steps

Start run

Observe event stream ordering (SSE)

Inspect canonical state snapshots at intermediate checkpoints

Expected Results

Evidence patches applied before decision proposals

Decision proposals exist before final decisions are set

Graph node generation occurs only after decisions are locked or gated

Data Integrity Checks

meta.updated_at increases monotonically across snapshots

No decision field is written by a non-orchestrator agent
